hamster resume 

    Let the hamster continue a job that had been interrupted.
    
    Hamster is designed for very large jobs that may run hours on end.
    If for whatever reason the hamster is interrupted (loss of power, loss
    of network, accidental process killing...), you can take the job back
    up where it was left. 

    During any job, every 15 seconds or so, a memento file is updated. 
    It contains the status of the exploration process, as well as all
    the content that was fully downloaded but not yet written to the disk.
    Content that was only partially downloaded at the time of the interruption
    is not saved in the memento, and will be downloaded again upon resume.
    
    hamster resume uses the memento file to carry on.
   
    A job can be interrupted and resumed several times without causing
    any data loss to the overall download job.
    
    hamster resume does not take any options.
