As a job goes on, when the hamster bumps into a link that can't be downloaded
because of what could be an intermittent failure (network error, 
server error...), the link is set aside in a retry list.
When the job completes, you are informed of those failures, and the list is left
in a file in the working directory, along with all the necessary information for 
a clean new attempt.

hamster retry info
    Tells you more about what has failed.

hamster retry
    Run a new attempt on the failed targets. If this time they do respond
    and if they contain new links, the links will be followed and explored
    as usual.

hamster dont retry
    Consider the failed links are a desperate cause, and clear the retry list.
