hamster lets you clone websites, online and offline.

hamster init
    Creates a job configuration file in the current folder.
    It's a text file where you'll describe exactly what you want to do.
    The sample file contains a cheat-sheet for the configuration language.
    For more information about the possibilities, run :
        hamster help configure

hamster 
    Starts the job. Each piece of content that's downloaded is immediately 
    written to the disk, in the local folder, as per the configuration.
    
    Besides, every 15 seconds or so, a memento file is updated. 
    The memento is the hamster's way of keeping track of what it knows so far. 
    It allows to carry on a job after an interruption, without starting from
    the front up.
        
hamster resume 
    The hamster starts by reading the memento file, and carries on from there.
    Take note that if you change the configuration file before resuming,
    inconsistencies and broken links may appear in the offline site.
